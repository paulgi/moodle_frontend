# moodle_frontend

This document uses two files:

##keats-frontend.html 
is the code that will be embeded into the webpage. It contains functions that will implement all the functionality that a designer requests per page. The purpose of this code is to either create new elements or hide elements that exist currently or to apply classes to exisiting elements. You should not use Javascript for any other purpose!!!

##std-theme.css
Is loaded in externally and is used to style up the classes that you applied in Javascript.


This decision was made to make the code alot more readable and to ensure modularity so that we can load in specific functions as needed.

##lightbox.html
This code should be embeded in a seperate HTML block.
